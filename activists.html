      <p3 >Ms Suu Kyi, now 73, spent much of her time between 1989 and 2010 in some form of detention because of her efforts to
      bring democracy to then military-ruled Myanmar (also known as Burma).  She led the National League for Democracy (NLD) to
      a majority win in Myanmar's first openly-contested election in 25 years in November 2015.  The win came five years to the day
      since she was released from 15 years of house arrest. </p3>
