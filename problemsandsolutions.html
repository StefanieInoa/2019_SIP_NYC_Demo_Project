      <p id="pay"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The gender pay gap is the gap between what men and women are paid. The gender pay gap is the result of many factors, including occupational segregation, bias against working mothers, and direct pay discrimination. Additionally, such things as racial bias, disability, access to education, and age come into play. Consequently, different groups of women experience very different gaps in pay.
The gender pay gap varies substantially from state to state, due to such factors as:
  The primary industries in the state and the opportunities they create;
  Demographics such as race/ethnicity, age, and education level;
  Regional differences in attitudes and beliefs about work and gender; and
  Differences in the scope and strength of state pay discrimination laws and policies.
