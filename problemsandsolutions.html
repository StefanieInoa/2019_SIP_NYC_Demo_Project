      Closing the gap will require multifaceted solutions that together help ensure that the work women perform is valued
      fairly, that women are not penalized unfairly for their caregiving responsibilities, and that there is greater transparency
      in workplace pay practices. Here are a couple of steps we could take that could make a difference.
      Raising the minimum wage will help
      hardworking women better support their families.

    <p><b>
      Women, especially women of color, are more likely to work in low-wage
     jobs and often have unpredictable schedules that can change with little notice, making it difficult for working parents—especially mothers—to
    anticipate their schedules and arrange for child care. These workers risk losing their job because they lack the flexibility to
    alter their schedules.

In many cultures, having girls marry young means a bride payment is coming to the family and that is money that is needed. In Iran, for example, 99%
of the arranged marriages that occur involved a bride payment. The family might benefit in such a culture, but the girls do not often benefit much at all. They often drop out of school,
especially if the marriage occurs before the age of 18, and are more likely to remain in poverty over the course of their lives. They have greater health risks and even if there is love present, there is still a higher chance of violence occurring. With 2 out of 3 girls getting married as a teen in industrialized or westernized nations, it isn’t necessarily a foreign culture that has an arranged marriage any more. It could be our very own culture.
