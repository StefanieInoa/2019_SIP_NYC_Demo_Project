      The gender pay gap is the gap between what men and women are paid. The gender pay gap is the result of many factors,
      including occupational segregation, bias against working mothers, and direct pay discrimination. Additionally,
      such things as racial bias, disability, access to education, and age come into play. Consequently, different groups
      of women experience very different gaps in pay.
      The gender pay gap varies substantially from state to state, due to such factors as:
      The primary industries in the state and the opportunities they create;
      Demographics such as race/ethnicity, age, and education level;
      Regional differences in attitudes and beliefs about work and gender; and
      Differences in the scope and strength of state pay discrimination laws and policies.

     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Closing the gap will require multifaceted solutions that together help ensure that the work women perform is valued
      fairly, that women are not penalized unfairly for their caregiving responsibilities, and that there is greater transparency
     in workplace pay practices. Here are a couple of steps we could take that could make a difference.
    Raising the minimum wage will help
     hardworking women better support their families.

  Women, especially women of color, are more likely to work in low-wage
     jobs and often have unpredictable schedules that can change with little notice, making it difficult for working parents—especially mothers—to
    anticipate their schedules and arrange for child care. These workers risk losing their job because they lack the flexibility to
    alter their schedules.
