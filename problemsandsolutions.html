<h1 class="gender"> The gender wage gap</h1>

<p id="gap">
  The gender pay gap is the gap between what men and women are paid. Most commonly, it refers to the median annual pay of all women who work full time and year-round, compared to the pay
  of a similar cohort of men. Other estimates of the gender pay gap are based on weekly or hourly earnings, or are specific to a particular group
  of women.The gender pay gap is the result of many factors, including occupational segregation, bias against working mothers, and direct paydiscrimination. Additionally, such things
   as racial bias, disability, access to education, and age come into play. Consequently, different groups of women experience very different gaps in pay.
</p>
<p id="gap">
  Here are some steps we can take to make a difference:
  Women make up a disproportionate share of low-wage workers, and estimates show that differences between women’s and men’s occupations could account for
  nearly one-half of the gender wage gap. Raising the minimum wage will help hardworking women better support their families. While nearly
  two-thirds of mothers are breadwinners or co-breadwinners for their families, women made up approximately two-thirds of all minimum-wage workers in 2012.
</p>

<h1 class="gender"> Forced marriages </h1>

<p id="gap">

Forced child marriage is a pervasive problem across the developing world that has violated the human
rights of more than 60 million girls and continues to undermine global development efforts. A variety of factors
contribute to the practice, including poverty, lack of education and the force of deeply-rooted tradition. Early marriage –
 some girls are as young as 8 – not only robs girls of their childhood, but also thwarts initiatives aimed at raising their education
 levels and reducing maternal mortality rates.
</p>
<p id="gap">
    <img id="arrange" src="arrange.jpg">
  However, forced child marriage is surmountable. Education is the single most important factor associated with girls marrying before the age of 18,
   according to ICRW research. “When we enroll more girls in school, marriage rates go down. When girls learn about their rights and have access to
   income-generating opportunities, they create alternatives to marriage,” Malhotra said. “And when social norms change and families have access to
   community support, they will delay marriage for their daughters.”
Efforts proven to delay the age of marriage for girls also include providing opportunities for them to learn life skills, such as how to
  communicate with others, and that raise awareness
  among parents, teachers and other influential adults about the health and social consequences for child brides.
  The International Protecting Girls by <a class="edu" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2140/text">Preventing Child Marriage Act </a>, introduced in 2009, begins to outline some of these solutions. With the
  political will and resources authorized in this legislation, the United States can support efforts to bring down perceptibly the rate of forced
   child marriage over the next few years.

<h1 class="gender">Education </h1>
<p id="gap">
The brief reveals the various barriers leading to low participation, performance and completion rates for girls,
and emphasizes how some of these obstacles are themselves worsened by a lack of girls’ education.Social barriers,
such as unequal gender norms, child marriage and early pregnancy in the region severely reduce the likelihood of
 girls staying in school.As women are traditionally valued for their domestic work and fertility, it can be difficult
 for families to see investment in girls’ formal education as beneficial, and they may decide that marriage is a better option.
</p>

<p id="gap">
  <a class="edu" href="https://www.globalpartnership.org/focus-areas/girls-education">Gender Equality Policy </a> supports countries' efforts to develop, finance, and implement education sector plans that are gender-responsive.
  These plans include specific measures to reduce gender disparities, and make teaching and learning more responsive to
   the needs of both girls and boys. Improvements in the physical school environment such as separate toilets for girls
   and access to menstrual hygiene products are also included. Together with the United Nations Girls' Education Initiative
   GPE has developed guidelines to support gender-responsive education sector analysis and planning.
  Provision of grants to partner countries for implementation of education sector plans that promote gender equality:
  At least 33 GPE program implementation grants totaling US$1.5 billion supplement domestic investments in gender equality.

<h1 class="gender"> Underespresented in Politics</h1>
<p id="gap">
  The United States has fallen behind most established democracies with respect to women’s representation in politics. Women remain underrepresented
   at the federal, state, and local levels. The current uptick in women running for office, while encouraging, is unlikely to close this gender gap.
    To accelerate the pace of progress, U.S. reformers  could learn from European experiences and push for measures that tackle broader institutional barriers to equal political representation.
  In the United States, women generally win elections at the same rate as men—but they are less likely to run for office. The majoritarian
   electoral system, a strong incumbency advantage, gender-specific fundraising hurdles, and weaknesses in party recruitment reinforce this imbalance.
</p>
<p id="gap">
   Steps to ensure equal access to political office in the United States
  Expand ranked-choice voting in multimember districts—beginning at the municipal and state levels—to push party officials to recruit
   a more diverse slate of candidates and weaken the incentives for negative campaigning.
  Institute mandatory or voluntary recruitment targets for political parties and well-resourced party mechanisms to identify, recruit,
   and support women candidates—particularly at the primary stage and in open-seat races.
  This step would signal high-level commitment to gender parity and ensure the continuous recruitment of qualified female candidates.
